# Hands-on-Assignment-2
# **Chicago House Price prediction**
## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Chicago using machine learning techniques. By implementing both regression and classification models, we analyze key factors influencing housing prices and develop accurate predictive models.

## **Models Used**

### **Regression:**
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Ridge Regression

### **Regression Conclusion:** 

The Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with an R² score of 0.871, indicating that it explains approximately 87.1% of the variance in house prices. The Random Forest Regressor also performed well with an R² score of 0.857. Both the Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models exhibited lower performance with scores of 0.688 each, suggesting that more complex models are better suited for this prediction task.

### **Classification:**
Decision Tree classifier

Random Forest classification 

Gradient Boost classifier

### **Classification Conclusions:**

The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 95%, making it the most effective model for classifying house prices in Chicago. The Decision Tree Classifier followed closely with 93% accuracy, while the Gradient Boost Classifier showed a lower performance with an accuracy of 84%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods like Random Forest in capturing complex patterns within the housing data.
